- the community cards have been added in this run

- the whole culture contained only one community card (third flop), and this was in dead code

- so I guess evolution decided that community is not really interesting

- community was there at the beginning, but it seemed that it was used to create some randomness, e.g., depending on the second flop we do this or that

- but in the end community was rarely used
