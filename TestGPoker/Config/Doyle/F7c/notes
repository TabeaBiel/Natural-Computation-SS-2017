Culture run with 7 inputs

Player input

0 - high hole
1 - low hole
2 - hand value
3 - pot value
4 - call value
5 - stage value
6 - position


- there was a bug with multiple re-raises, where the pot could be distributed incorrectly, I do not think it affected much, but I do not know

- in this run the bug was already fixed

- 6 masters, 1 shorty, good culture

- M1413 seems to be very good


- this is M1413

ifm <=d vard[3] *d vard[2] cd[0.5247] ifm <=d vard[2] cd[0.3684] cm[Call] cm[Raise(1.4905)] ifm <=d vard[2] cd[0.3322] cm[Check] cm[Raise(0.9014)] 

if pot small (relative to hand) call until two pair, raise above
if pot larger check until pair, raise above
