- made some speed up, features are only calculated when changing, e.g., the hand value stays the same in a stage when raising and re-raising

- very roughly it saves 1/3 of computation time

- culture has 7 masters, the last is just a visitor, it is strange that it loses against all in tournaments, not clear how it gets into the culture
