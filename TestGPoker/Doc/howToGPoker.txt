How to GPoker:

--- Start a tournament with GPoker ---
1. Make gpoker.jar, JEvolution.jar, and jdom-2.0.5.jar available in your class path
2. Select XML config file
3. Start main class gp.Director

--- Use different XML config files ---
 - Default file name is "gpoker.xml"
 - To use other files execute with args -x <Filename>
 
--- Create an XML config file ---
 - Take a look at the documentation at section 3.2 XML-Configuration
 - Or at the XML samples (e.g., sample1.xml)
 
--- Add a new AI Player to GPoker ---
1. Create a new class in the gpoker.players package
2. Let it extend the abstract Player class
3. Implement abstract methods (javadoc of all methods in doc folder or look a the java code)
4. Connect your new class with your AI core
	- act is called whenever the player has to make a move
	- isTrusted returns if the moves returned by the player have to be checked for not violating any poker rules (in general this should return false)
5. Create (or change) an XML config file and add your new player
6. Take a look at the already implemented players (e.g., RandomPlayer.java) for more help
7. Or read the documentation at section 3.1.5 Strategies
